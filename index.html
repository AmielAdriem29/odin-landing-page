            <h1>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn't A Guy At All!</h1>
            <p>Affectionately dubbed the <span>‘green yuri manga’</span> due to its striking green cover
                and distinctive green-tinted panels, The story follows high schooler <span id="aya">Aya
                Oosawa</span>, who has a massive crush on a record store clerk she frequently
                visits. What she doesn’t realize is that the ‘cool and mysterious guy’ she
                admires is actually a ‘cool, mysterious, and slightly shy’ girl—<span id="koga">Mitsuki
                Koga</span>—who also happens to be her classmate. To make things even more awkward,
                Mitsuki sits right next to Aya in class, forced to listen as Aya gushes
                about her crush, all while sweating over how Aya will react when she
                inevitably discovers the truth. As the two bond over their shared love of
                rock music, their relationship slowly evolves from friendship into something
                more.
